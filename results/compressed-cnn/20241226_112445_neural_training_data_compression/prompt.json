    "task_description": "You are given the following file to work with, which studies training Convolutional neural networks by training multiple models on the MNIST dataset where the data is compressed. Please come up with interesting experiments to investigate the effect of data compression schemes on network training loss and accuracy. The goal is to compare and contrast various data compression schemes."
