    "Summary": "The paper addresses the challenge of compressing large training datasets for deep learning while retaining the necessary information for effective model training. It systematically compares four compression techniques: Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Random Projection, Spatial Downsampling, and Binary Thresholding. The key finding is that preserving spatial structure is crucial for maintaining model performance. Experiments on MNIST demonstrate that methods like Spatial Downsampling (98.63% accuracy) and Binary Thresholding (98.47% accuracy) outperform structure-agnostic methods like Random Projection (10.81% accuracy).",
