    "Summary": "The paper 'AdaptCompression: Dynamic Sample-Aware Data Compression for Efficient Deep Learning' proposes a novel framework, AdaptCompression, which dynamically adjusts data compression levels based on the importance of samples during training. The framework uses discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients and tracks per-sample loss values to apply more aggressive compression to well-learned samples and preserve higher fidelity for challenging examples. Experiments on the MNIST dataset demonstrate that this approach maintains model accuracy at 95.58% while reducing training time by 2.3%.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a significant and practical problem in deep learning related to computational and storage demands during training.",
        "The proposed dynamic compression framework is novel and leverages the DCT-based compression in an innovative way to adjust the compression levels based on sample learning difficulty.",
        "Initial experimental results on the MNIST dataset show that the approach can maintain accuracy while reducing training time."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The experimental validation is limited to the MNIST dataset, which is relatively simple and may not fully demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of the approach on more complex datasets.",
        "There is a lack of clarity and detail in the methodology, particularly regarding the implementation of the adaptive thresholding mechanism and the compression levels.",
        "The potential computational overhead of tracking per-sample loss statistics and dynamically adjusting compression levels is not thoroughly addressed.",
        "The paper does not explore the generalization of the approach to more complex architectures and datasets, limiting the assessment of its broader impact and applicability."
