    "Summary": "The paper 'THE COMPRESSION-ROBUSTNESS TRADE-OFF: CRITICAL THRESHOLDS IN DCT-BASED NEURAL LEARNING' investigates the impact of DCT-based compression on the robustness of neural networks, focusing on the trade-off between compression efficiency and model resilience under noisy conditions. The study uses MNIST as a testbed and examines different DCT coefficient mask sizes and noise levels, revealing critical thresholds for maintaining model performance.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a relevant and timely issue of balancing compression efficiency and model robustness.",
        "Systematic and well-designed experiments with clear findings on the thresholds for compression and noise.",
        "Practical implications for deploying neural networks in resource-constrained environments."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Limited to experiments on MNIST, which might affect the generalizability of the findings.",
        "Does not explore more diverse noise types and compression techniques.",
        "Lacks a broader evaluation on more complex datasets.",
        "Insufficient details for reproducibility; lacks specifics on implementation and hyperparameters.",
        "The choice of model architecture is not well-justified and seems overly simplistic.",
        "The paper lacks a robust theoretical analysis to support the empirical observations."

    "Questions": [
        "Have you considered testing your approach on more complex datasets beyond MNIST?",
        "Can you explore more diverse noise types that might be encountered in real-world scenarios?",
        "Why were only 8x8 and 16x16 DCT mask sizes chosen? Could intermediate sizes provide more nuanced insights?",
        "What is the rationale behind the chosen noise levels (\u03c3 = 0.1, 0.2)? Could other noise levels affect the results differently?",
        "Can the authors provide more details on the specific choices of network architecture and training parameters?",
        "Can the authors provide more theoretical insights into the impact of different DCT block sizes on model robustness?",
        "What specific failure modes are observed in models under different compression and noise settings?",
        "How would adaptive compression techniques perform compared to the fixed 8x8 and 16x16 DCT settings?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The scope is limited to MNIST, which might not fully represent the challenges in more complex datasets.",
        "More diverse noise types and compression techniques could have been analyzed.",
        "The choice of specific DCT mask sizes and noise levels seems arbitrary and lacks justification. A broader exploration could strengthen the conclusions.",
        "The paper lacks clarity in some methodological details and would benefit from more thorough explanations and justifications.",
        "The study is limited to MNIST and may not generalize to more complex datasets.",
        "The paper lacks sufficient details for reproducibility.",
        "More theoretical analysis is needed to support the empirical results.",
        "Detailed failure analysis is missing, making it hard to understand why certain compressions degrade performance more than others."
