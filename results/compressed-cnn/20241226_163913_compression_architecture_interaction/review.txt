    "Summary": "The paper proposes a framework called CompressedNet for joint optimization of network width and input compression. It evaluates the trade-offs between architectural capacity and input information density using width multipliers and DCT compression ratios on the MNIST dataset. The findings suggest that moderate compression with reduced width can improve both accuracy and efficiency, challenging conventional wisdom about model capacity and performance trade-offs.",
