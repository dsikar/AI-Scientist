#### Your goal is to implement the following idea: Investigating Single-Channel and Multi-Channel RGB Approaches in Neural Network Image Classification: A Study of Information Content and Model Performance.  
#### The proposed experiment is as follows: This research aims to determine whether using a single RGB channel, or fusing two or three RGB channels into a single representation, can preserve sufficient information for an image classifier neural network. We will evaluate classifier performance (accuracy, precision, recall) on standard datasets, comparing single-channel, dual-channel, and fully fused multi-channel inputs against the traditional three-channel RGB format. The study will also explore how channel selection or fusion impacts training dynamics, such as convergence speed and model generalization, and examine if certain channels or channel combinations retain key features crucial for classification tasks. Potential benefits include reduced computational overhead and simpler model architectures, offering insights into the minimal necessary color information needed for high-performing image classification models. Our baseline runs on channel 0 (assumed Red)..  
#### You are given a total of up to 5 runs to complete the necessary experiments. You do not need to use all 5.  
####   
#### First, plan the list of experiments you would like to run. For example, if you are sweeping over a specific hyperparameter, plan each value you would like to test for each run.  
####   
#### Note that we already provide the vanilla baseline results, so you do not need to re-run it.  
####   
#### For reference, the baseline results are as follows:  
####   
#### {'cifar10': {'best_val_acc_mean': 77.95, 'test_acc_mean': 77.95, 'total_train_time_mean': 5919.307706594467}}  
####   
#### After you complete each change, we will run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_i' where i is the run number and evaluate the results.  
#### YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS.  
#### You can then implement the next thing on your list.  

Let me plan the experiments to investigate different channel combinations and fusion approaches:

Planned Runs:
1. Run 0 (Already done): Baseline using Red channel (channel 0)
2. Run 1: Green channel (channel 1) - to compare performance across individual channels
3. Run 2: Blue channel (channel 2) - to complete single channel analysis
4. Run 3: Two-channel fusion (R+G) using averaging
5. Run 4: All-channel fusion (R+G+B) using averaging

Let's implement Run 1 first by modifying the code to support the Green channel experiment.

First, let's update the notes to track our experimental plan:

- Run 0: Red channel (Baseline)
- Run 1: Green channel
- Run 2: Blue channel
- Run 3: Two-channel fusion (R+G)
- Run 4: All-channel fusion (R+G+B)

## Run 0: Baseline (Red Channel)
Results: {'cifar10': {'best_val_acc_mean': 77.95, 'test_acc_mean': 77.95, 'total_train_time_mean': 5919.307706594467}}
Description: Baseline results using only the Red channel.

## Run 1: Green Channel
Description: Testing performance using only the Green channel to compare against Red channel baseline.

For Run 1, we'll use the existing code but set the channel parameter to 1 (Green). The command to run this experiment will be:

```bash
python experiment.py --out_dir=run_1
```

This will use the default channel=1 (Green) as specified in the Config class. After we get these results, we can proceed with Run 2 (Blue channel).
