    "Summary": "The paper proposes a method to enhance computational efficiency in image classification by selectively processing spatial regions within color channels using circular masking techniques. The authors demonstrate that models can maintain 91% of baseline accuracy while significantly reducing training time by 87%. The green channel is found to contain the most discriminative information, and the specific radius of center-periphery masking has minimal impact on performance.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The method addresses an important issue of computational efficiency in deep learning.",
        "The proposed approach shows significant computational savings with minimal loss in accuracy.",
        "The finding that the green channel contains the most discriminative information is interesting."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The experiments are limited to CIFAR-10, raising concerns about generalizability to other datasets or higher-resolution images.",
        "The method relies on fixed circular masks, which limits flexibility.",
        "There is a lack of detailed comparison with other advanced efficiency techniques.",
        "The paper lacks clarity in some sections, particularly in the detailed methodology and experimental setup.",
        "The potential impacts on test-time performance and inference speed are not discussed."

        "Can the authors provide experiments on more complex datasets to validate the generalizability of their findings?",

    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The method may not generalize well to more complex datasets or higher-resolution images.",
        "Fixed circular masks limit flexibility and may not capture the most informative regions for all images.",
        "The paper lacks detailed comparison with other advanced efficiency techniques.",
        "The consistent accuracy reduction suggests a trade-off that needs to be carefully managed in practical applications."
