    "task_description": "You are given the following file to work with, which studies training Convolutional neural networks with a single channel (either R, G or B), or a combination of two or more channel data combined into one channel. Please come up with interesting experiments to investigate the effect of using a single channel on network training loss and accuracy. The goal is to determine if certain channels carry more information content than others, or a combination of channel information may carry the same information content. Be sure to make notes and make explicit what channel or combinations of channels are being used. The baseline was run on channel 0 (Red), and the channel is set on the line 86 of the experiment.py script. Be sure to edit the line when training the network with the green and blue channels, and to adapt the code accordingly for channel combinations."
